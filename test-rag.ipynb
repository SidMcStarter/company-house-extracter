Review of the business and future developments\\n\\nThe overall strategy of Vodafone Limited (\"the Company”) is aligned to that of Vodafone Group Plc (“the Group”), which is outlined in the Group Strategy Review in the Group\\'s Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2016, which does not form part of this report.\\n\\nThe Company has transitioned to FRS 101 — Reduced Disclosure Framework for the preparation of these financial statements. Comparative information has been restated as appropriate; see note 1 to the financial statements for the impact of the adoption and the quantification of the historical adjustments.\\n\\nKey financial performance indicators for the Company include revenue, operating loss and average revenue per user (“ARPU”). Other non-financial key performance indicators include 4G coverage and 4G customer growth.\\n\\nTotal revenue declined 1.8%. An improving trend in fixed line enterprise revenue was offset by a slowdown in mobile. The period under review also saw the launch of the Company\\'s Consumer Broadband proposition.\\n\\nMobile contract customer growth slowed in the last quarter, impacted partly by higher churn reflecting operational challenges following a billing system migration. Mobile revenue was also impacted by the pricing and usage of O8XX numbers following the introduction of Non-Geographic Call Services regulation and a focus on giving customers more control of their out-of-bundle data spend.\\n\\nOutdoor 4G coverage reached 84% at 31 March 2016 (March 2015: 63%), or 91% based on the OFCOM definition, and the Company had 7.0 million 4G customers at the year end, up from 3.0 million at the prior year end. Contract ARPU reduced in the year to £26.50 (2015: £27.20) for reasons noted above.\\n\\nAn operating loss of £354.8m (2015: £308.9m loss) was incurred during the year.\\n\\nThe key goals for the year ahead are to stabilise customer operations after the billing system migration, further focus our investment in network assets and continue our drive on cost efficiency.\\n\\nFinancial position and liquidity\\n\\nThe Statement of Financial Position on page 11 of the financial statements shows the Company\\'s overall financial position at the end of the year.\\n\\nIn March 2016, the Company repaid the loan note through the issue of new share capital to the immediate parent at a premium of £6.3bn. This will reduce the Company\\'s annual interest expense by over €300m going ‘forward. The major source of liquidity for the Company comes from the cash generated from trading activities. The Group treasury function provides a centralised treasury service to the Company, including managing its cash flow risks and follows a framework of policies and guidelines authorised and-reviewed annually by the Group\\'s management.\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED Company No: 01471587 STRATEGIC REPORT (continued)\\n\\nFinancial position and liquidity (continued)\\n\\nThe Company closed the. year with cash of £19.0m (2015: €63.3m); excess funds are loaned to the Vodafone Group under cash sweep arrangements. For further details of current and long term amounts payable to and due from the parent company and fellow subsidiary undertakings, see notes 12, 13 and 14 of the financial statements.\\n\\nOn the basis of their assessment of the Company\\'s financial position, the factors likely to affect its future development and performance, and the enquiries made of the Directors of Vodafone Group Plc, who is its ultimate parent, the Company\\'s Directors have no reason to believe that a material uncertainty exists that may cast doubt about the ability of the Vodafone Group Plc to continue as a going concern. Accordingly they expect that the Company will be able to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and hence continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements. Going concern is discussed in note 1 to the financial statements.\\n\\nPrincipal risks and uncertainties\\n\\nThe Company has a clear framework for identifying and managing risk, both at an operational and strategic level. The Company has a dedicated Risk and Compliance team that coordinates risk management across the Company’s business, alongside an established Risk and Compliance Committee that is made up of members of the Company\\'s General Management Team.\\n\\nThe principal risks and uncertainties for the Company and mitigating factors are as follows:\\n\\na) _ Risk; Failure to protect customer information We host increasing quantities and types of customer data in both enterprise and consumer segments. Hardware and software applications include security features which are reviewed by our technology and corporate security functions to ensure compliance with our policies and security standards.\\n\\n5) Risk: Malicious Cyber Attack We recognise the increasing threat of malicious data loss or outages as a consequence of cyber-crime. This is mitigated by continuous monitoring of our IT infrastructure to identify threats and potential areas of weaknesses.\\n\\n©) Risk: Significant Outage to our Network or IT Systems Major failure or malicious attack on our network or IT systems may result in service interruption and consequential customer and revenue loss. Specific back-up and resilience requirements are built into our networks combined with regularly tested business continuity and disaster recovery plans.\\n\\n@ Risk: Key suppliers We depend on a limited number of suppliers for strategically important network and IT infrastructure and associated support services to operate and upgrade our networks and provide key services to our customers. We periodically review the performance of key suppliers, including identifying and managing y suppliers at risk” and having business continuity plans in case of supplier failure.\\n\\nDirector Date: 9 September 2016\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED Company No: 01471587 REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS\\n\\nThe directors present their report and the audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2016. :\\n\\nLoss and dividends\\n\\nFor the year ended 31 March 2016, the Company reported a loss for the financial year of £658.2m (2015: £536.9m loss).

These schemes provide employees with the opportunity to acquire Vodafone Group Plc’s shares on an advantageous basis and they are operated with tax benefits under HM Revenue & Customs approved share scheme arrangements. There is a high level of employee participation.\\n\\nConsultation with employees or their representatives has continued at all levels, with the aim of ensuring that their views are taken into account when decisions are made that are likely to affect their interests and that all employees are aware of the financial and economic performance of their business units and of the Company as a whole. Communication with all employees continues through the in-house newsletters and bulletins, briefing groups and the distribution of the quarterly financial results.\\n\\nDisabled persons\\n\\nApplications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the respective aptitudes and abilities of the applicant concerned. In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment with the Company continues and the appropriate training is arranged.

The registered address of the Company is Vodafone House, The Connection, Newbury, Berkshire, RG14 2FN, England.\\n\\nGoing concern\\n\\nThe directors are satisfied that, at the time of approving the financial statements, it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. The Company\\'s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the strategic report on page 2.\\n\\nThe Directors have reviewed the financial position of the Company, including the arrangements with Vodafone Group Plc.

Accordingly they expect that the Company will be able to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and hence continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.\\n\\nStatement of directors’ responsibilities\\n\\nThe directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Report of the Directors and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.\\n\\nCompany law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101).\\n\\nUnder company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:\\n\\ne select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\\n\\n¢ state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 have been followed subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;\\n\\n¢ notify the Company\\'s shareholders in writing about the use of disclosure exemptions, if any, of FRS 101 used in the preparation of financial statements; and\\n\\n© prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.\\n\\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company\\'s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.

The Directors have also considered the financial position of the Company\\'s ultimate parent Vodafone Group Plc, including centralised treasury arrangements.\\n\\nOn the basis of their assessment of the Company\\'s financial position and of the enquiries made of the Directors of Vodafone Group Plc, the Company\\'s Directors have no reason to believe that a material uncertainty exists that may cast doubt about the ability of the Vodafone Group Plc to continue as a going concern. Accordingly they expect that the Company will be able to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and hence continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.\\n\\n14\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\n\\nThe accounting policies that materially impact the financial statement are as follows:\\n\\nRevenue recognition\\n\\nRevenue, which excludes sales taxes, results from sale of telecommunications services and equipment to customers. In respect of the mobile services this includes monthly access charges, airtime usage, messaging and handset sales. In respect of the fixed line services this includes fixed line telecommunications services including data and voice services and the sale of equipment.\\n\\nAccess charges and airtime used by contract customers are invoiced and recorded as part of a periodic billing cycle and recognised as revenue over the related access period. Revenue from the sale of prepaid credit is deferred until such time as the customer uses the airtime, or the credit expires.\\n\\nFor equipment sales made to intermediaries, revenue is recognised if the significant risks associated with the equipment are transferred to the intermediary and the intermediary has no general right of return. If the significant risks are not transferred, revenue recognition is deferred until sale of the handset to an end customer by the intermediary or the expiry of the right of return.\\n\\nIn revenue arrangements including more than one deliverable, the arrangements are divided into separate units of accounting. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting if the following two conditions are met; (i) the deliverable has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and (ii) there is evidence of the fair value of the item. The arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on its relative fair value. Revenue allocated to deliverables is restricted to the amount that is receivable without the delivery of additional goods or services. This restriction typically applies to revenue recognised for devices provided to customers, including handsets.\\n\\nAmounts payable by telecommunications operators for interconnection and transmission of content are recognised as the services are provided. Charges are negotiated separately and are subject to continual review. Revenue generated through the provision of these services is accounted for gross of any amounts payable to other telecommunications operators for interconnect fees. in certain instances the Company uses estimates to determine the amount of income receivable, and these estimates may be subject to retrospective adjustment. These estimates are periodically adjusted to reflect actual pricing or usage, the adjustments being recognised in the year in which they are made.\\n\\nRevenue from data services and information provision is recognised when the Company has performed the related service and, depending on the nature of the service, is recognised either at the gross amount billed to the customer or the amount receivable by the Company as commission for facilitating the service.\\n\\n15\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED — NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\n\\nAcquisition and retention commissions\\n\\nIntermediaries are given cash incentives by the Company to connect new mobile customers and upgrade existing customers. Costs are recognised as an expense in cost of sales for the period in which they are incurred or where related to future performance, recognised in future periods on an accruals basis when contractual conditions have been satisfied.\\n\\nIntangible assets\\n\\nPurchased intangible assets, including licence fees, are capitalised at cost and stated at cost less amortisation and provision for impairment.\\n\\n(i)\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\n(iii)\\n\\nGoodwill\\n\\nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Company\\'s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity recognised at the date of acquisition.\\n\\nGoodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost tess any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not subject to amortisation, but is tested annually for impairment or whenever there is evidence that it may be required. Goodwill is denominated in the currency of the acquired entity and revalued to the closing exchange rate at each reporting period date.\\n\\nGoodwill arising before the date of transition to FRS101, on 1 April 2015, is recognised at the net book value prevailing at that date, subject to being tested for impairment. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.\\n\\nLicence fees\\n\\nLicence fees are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic life. The amortisation period for the Company\\'s 3G licence fees is 17.1 years. The amortisation period for the Company\\'s 4G licence fees is 20 years.\\n\\nComputer software\\n\\nCosts associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.\\n\\nDevelopment and acquisition costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable software products controlled by the Company are recognised as intangible assets.\\n\\nComputer software costs recognised as assets are amortised using the straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which does not exceed 5 years.\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n1, Statement of accounting policies (continued) Property, plant and equipment\\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairments.\\n\\nIncluded within the cost of network infrastructure systems are materials awaiting installation which are valued at cost less a provision for excess and obsolete items. The materials are used in the construction and maintenance of new and existing infrastructure and, when issued, are charged either to the cost of specific infrastructure or to the Income Statement.\\n\\nThe cost of property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in its acquisition and installation.\\n\\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment\\n\\nDepreciation is not provided on freehold land. Depreciation of plant and equipment is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than assets under construction, to their residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated usefut lives, as follows:\\n\\nFreehold buildings 40-50 years Leasehold improvements 5-40 years Plant and machinery 1-7 years Motor vehicles 4 years Furniture and fittings 5-10 years Network infrastructure 5-40 years Investments\\n\\nInvestments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value. The performance of investments is reviewed annually at each year end to establish whether there has been a impairment in the value of the investment which would necessitate a provision.\\n\\nAsset impairment\\n\\nIntangible assets and property, plant and equipment that are subject to amortisation are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where an impairment indicator is identified, the carrying value of the income generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount. Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value an impairment is recognised. :\\n\\nAn impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.\\n\\nInventory\\n\\nInventory is valued at the Lower of cost and estimated net realisable value. Provision is made where inventory is slow moving or obsolete to reduce cost to its net realisable value, calculated with reference to historic sales experience and forecast demand. .\\n\\n17\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\n\\nLeases\\n\\nRental costs under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement in equal annual amounts over the periods of the leases.\\n\\nAssets acquired under finance leases, which transfer substantially all the rights and obligations of ownership, are accounted for as though purchased outright. The fair value of the asset at the inception of the lease is included in property, plant and equipment and the capital element of the leasing commitment included in creditors. Finance charges are calculated on an actuarial basis and are allocated over each lease to produce a constant rate of charge on the outstanding balance.\\n\\nTaxation\\n\\nCurrent tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\\n\\nDeferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those which are included in financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\\n\\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period and adjusted to reflect changes in the Company\\'s assessment that sufficient taxable profits will be available within the UK tax group to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\\n\\nForeign currencies -\\n\\nTransactions in currencies other than the Company\\'s reporting currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate prevailing on the date when fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange. differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the Income Statement for the period.\\n\\nJoint operations\\n\\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, retating to the arrangement or that other facts and circumstances indicate that this is the case. The Company\\'s share of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows are combined with the equivalent items in the financial statements on a line-by-line basis. :\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n1, Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\n\\nPensions\\n\\nThe Company participates in both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.\\n\\n(i)\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nDefined benefit pension schemes\\n\\nThe asset or deficit recognised in the Statement of Financial Position in respect of the defined benefit plan represents the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligations at the reporting date. Net plan assets are recognised only to the extent that the present value of the economic benefit is available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Defined benefit obligations for the scheme are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the Projected unit method. The present value of these obligations is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid. The bonds used have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligation.\\n\\nThe Company recognises actuarial gains and losses, arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions, in the period in which they occur in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the Income Statement, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employee remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In these cases, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\\n\\nCurrent service costs and any past service costs, together with the unwinding of the discount on plan liabilities less the expected return on plan assets, are included within operating costs.\\n\\nDefined contribution pension schemes\\n\\nFor defined contribution schemes, the Company pays contributions to independently administered funds. The Company has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.\\n\\nDefined contribution pension costs charged to the Income Statement represent contributions payable in respect of the year.\\n\\nFinancial assets\\n\\nThe Company classifies its financial assets under loans and receivables: Non-derivative financial assets with “fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. The Company\\'s loans and receivables comprise receivables and cash. The Company has no financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.\\n\\nTrade and other receivables mainly consist of amounts owed to us by customers, fellow group undertakings and amounts that we pay to our suppliers in advance. Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based on the ageing of the receivable balances and historical experience. Individual trade receivables are written off when management deems them not to be collectable.\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued) Borrowings\\n\\nInterest bearing loans are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to cost at inception), and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, except where they are identified as a hedged item in a designated hedge relationship. Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the amount due on settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowing.\\n\\nCreditors\\n\\nCreditors are obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. ,\\n\\nCreditors are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.\\n\\nShare-based payments\\n\\nThe Vodafone Group Plc issues equity-settled share awards to certain of the Company’s employees. Equity- settled share-based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company\\'s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. Fair value is measured using a binomial pricing model which is calibrated using a Black-Scholes option pricing framework. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management\\'s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioral considerations.\\n\\nWhere the Vodafone Group Plc grants rights or share options over its shares to employees of the Company, the Company records this as a capital contribution directly in equity. Where the Company makes cash payments to its ultimate parent in respect of any rights or share options granted, such cash contributions are accounted for as a reduction in the capital contribution received (see note 20).\\n\\nFinance costs Finance costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred. Provisions\\n\\nProvisions for asset restoration obligations, restructuring costs and other claims are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre- tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specific to the obligation.\\n\\n20\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued) Critical accounting estimates and judgements\\n\\nEstimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\\n\\nThe Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.\\n\\n(a) Revenue recognition @) Arrangements with multiple deliverables\\n\\nIn revenue arrangements where more than one good or service is provided to the customer, customer consideration is allocated between the goods and services using relative fair value principles. The fair values determined for deliverables may impact the timing of the recognition of revenue.\\n\\nDetermining the fair value of each deliverable can require complex estimates. The Company generally determines the fair value of individual elements based on prices at which the deliverable is regularly sold on a stand-alone basis after considering any appropriate volume discounts.\\n\\n(ii) Gross versus net presentation\\n\\nWhen the Company sells goods or services as a principal, income and payments to suppliers are reported on a gross basis in revenue and operating costs. If the Company sells goods or services as an agent, revenue and payments to suppliers are recorded in revenue on a net basis, representing the margin earned. Whether the Company is considered to be the principal or an agent in the transaction depends on analysis by management of both the legal form and substance of the agreement between the Company and its business partners; such judgements impact the amount of reported revenue and operating expenses but do not impact reported assets, liabilities or cash flows.\\n\\n(b) Taxation\\n\\nThe Company\\'s tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges. The calculation of the Company\\'s total tax charge involves estimation and judgement in respect of certain matters where the tax impact is uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax authority or through a Legal process. The final resolution of some of these items, which can take many years, may give rise to material profits, losses and/or cash flows.\\n\\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets, particularly in respect of tax losses, is based upon whether it is probable that there will be sufficient and suitable taxable profits in the Company or the UK tax group against which to utilise the assets in the future. .\\n\\nJudgement is required when determining probable future taxable profits. The Company assesses the availability of future taxable profits using the same undiscounted five year forecasts for the Company\\'s operations as are used in the Group’s value in use calculations. Where tax losses are forecast to be recovered beyond the five year period, the availability of taxable profits is assessed using the cash flows and long-term growth rates used for the vatue in use calculations.\\n\\n21\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\n\\n(b) Taxation (continued)\\n\\n(c\\n\\n~~\\n\\nChanges in the assumptions which underpin the Company\\'s forecasts could have an impact on the amount of future taxable profits and could have a significant impact on the period over which the deferred tax asset would be recovered.\\n\\nThe Company only considers substantively enacted tax laws when assessing the amount and availability of tax Losses to offset against the future taxable profits. See note 7 “Income tax on ordinary activities”.\\n\\nFinite lived intangible assets\\n\\nOther intangible assets include amounts spent by the Company acquiring investments, licences fees and the costs of purchasing and developing computer software.\\n\\nWhere intangible assets are acquired through business combinations and no active market for the assets exists, the fair value of these assets is determined by discounting estimated future net cash flows generated by the asset. Estimates relating to the future cash flows and discount rates used may have a material effect on the reported amounts of finite lived intangible assets.\\n\\nThe useful life over which intangible assets are amortised depends on management\\'s estimate of the period over which economic benefit will be derived from the asset. Reducing the useful life will increase the amortisation charge in the Income Statement. Useful lives are periodically reviewed to ensure that they remain appropriate. The basis for determining the useful life for the most significant categories of intangible assets is discussed below.\\n\\nThe estimated useful life of licence fees is generally the term of the licence unless there is a presumption of renewal at negligible cost; this is adjusted if necessary, for example taking into account the impact of any expected changes in technology.\\n\\nThe useful life of software is based on management\\'s view, considering historical experience with similar products as well as anticipation of future events which may impact their life such as changes | in technology. The useful life will not exceed the duration of the licence.\\n\\n(d) Property, plant and equipment\\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment represents 25.9% (2015: 23.9%) of the Company\\'s total assets; estimates and assumptions made may have a material impact on their carrying value and related depréciation charge. See note 9 “Property, plant and equipment.\\n\\nThe depreciation charge for an asset is derived using estimates of its expected useful life and expected residual value, which are reviewed annually. Increasing an asset\\'s expected life or residual value would result in a reduced depreciation charge in the Income Statement. Management determines the useful tives and residual values for assets when they are acquired, based on experience with similar assets and taking into account other relevant factors such as any expected changes in technology. The useful life of network infrastructure is assumed not to exceed the duration of related operating licences unless there is a reasonable expectation of renewal or an alternative future use for the asset.\\n\\n22\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\n\\n(e) Post-employment benefits\\n\\niC)\\n\\n~\\n\\nManagement judgement is exercised when determining the Company\\'s liabilities and expenses arising for defined benefit pension schemes. Management is required to make assumptions regarding future rates of inflation, salary increases, discount rates and longevity of members, each of which may have a material impact on the defined benefit obligations that are recorded. Further details, including a sensitivity analysis, are included in note 21 “Post-employment benefits”.\\n\\nImpairment reviews\\n\\nIFRS requires management to perform impairment tests annually for indefinite lived assets and, for finite lived assets, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\\n\\nImpairment testing requires management to judge whether the carrying value of assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows that they generate. Calculating the net present value of the future cash flows requires assumptions to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters including management\\'s expectations of:\\n\\ne — Growth in EBITDA, calculated as adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation; ¢ — Timing and amount of future capital expenditure, licence and spectrum payments;\\n\\n© — Long-term growth rates; and\\n\\n¢ — Appropriate discount rates to reflect the risks involved.\\n\\nManagement prepares formal five year forecasts for the Company\\'s operations, which are used to\\n\\nestimate their value in use. ~\\n\\nChanging the assumptions selected by management, in particular the discount rate and growth rate assumptions used in the cash flow projection, could significantly affect the Company\\'s impairment evaluation and hence reported assets and profits or losses.\\n\\nProvisions\\n\\nThe Company exercises judgement in measuring and recognising provisions. A provision is determined based on the best estimate of amounts required to settle the obligation taking into account all available information. Given the uncertainties inherent in the estimates used to determine the amount of the provision, actual outflow of resources may differ from the amounts recognised originally on the basis of the estimates.\\n\\n23\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n2.

A further reduction in the UK corporation tax rate was announced in the 2016 Finance Bill to further reduce the tax rate to 17% (to be effective from 1° April 2020).\\n\\nThis further rate reduction was not substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date. Therefore the rate of 18% (2015: 20%) has been used to calculate the deferred tax asset/(liability), with an adjustment being made for the expected movement in the asset/(liability) at the 19% rate during the years ended 31 March 2017, 31 March 2018, 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2020.\\n\\nAn amount of £98.0m (2015: £3.5m) was charged to the Income Statement in respect of this rate reduction.\\n\\nThe standard rate of tax for the year, based on the UK standard rate of corporation tax, is 20% (2015: 21%).

IFRS 2 requires that equity-settled share-based payments issued to the Company\\'s employees are measured at fair value and that this value is expensed over the vesting period, with an equivalent credit taken directly in equity as a capital contribution. On exercise of the shares by employees, the company is charged the intrinsic value of the share by Vodafone Group Ple.

The savings and bonus may then be used to purchase shares at the option price, which is set at the beginning of the invitation period and usually at a discount of 20% to the then prevailing market price of the shares.\\n\\n(ii) Share plans\\n\\nVodafone Group executive plans\\n\\nUnder the Vodafone Global Incentive Plan awards of shares are granted to directors and certain employees.

Post-employment benefits\\n\\nThe Company\\'s pension plans are provided through both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements. Defined benefit schemes provide benefits based on the employees’ length of pensionable service and their final pensionable salary or other criteria. Defined contribution schemes offer employees individuat funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement. :\\n\\nDefined benefit plans\\n\\nThe defined benefit plans are administered by Trustee Boards that are legally separated from the Company. The Trustee Board of each pension fund consists of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Company. The Boards of the pension funds are required by law to act in the best interest of the plan participants and are responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment and contribution policies, and the governance of the fund.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s main defined benefit scheme is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (‘Vodafone UK plan’). There are two segregated sections of the Vodafone UK plan, the pre-existing assets and liabilities of the Vodafone UK plan in the Vodafone Section and the former Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan CCWWRP”) assets and liabilities, which were transferred into the Vodafone UK plan on 6 June 2014, in the CWW Section, with the CWWRP then being wound up. The pre-existing Vodafone UK plan and the former CWWRP plan closed to future accrual on 31 March 2010 and 30 November 2013 respectively. Until 30 November 2013 the CWRP allowed employees to accrue a pension at a rate of 1/85th of their final salary for each year of service until the retirement age of 60 with a maximum pension of two thirds of final salary. Employees contributed 5% of their salary into the scheme.\\n\\n_ The Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HMRC and is subject to UK legislation and oversight from the Pensions Regulator. UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and that valuations are undertaken at least every three years. Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section. Within 15 months of each vatuation date, the plan trustees and the Company must agree any contributions required to ensure that the plan is fully funded over time on a suitably prudent measure.\\n\\nThe most recent valuations for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section of the Vodafone UK plan were carried out as at 31 March 2013 by independent actuaries appointed by the plan trustees. These valuations revealed a total deficit of £437 million on the schemes’ funding basis. Following the valuation, the Company paid special one-off contributions totalling £279 million in April 2014 (€239 million into the Vodafone Section and £40 million into the CWW Section). These lump sum contributions represented accelerated funding amounts that would otherwise have been due over the period to 31 March 2020. No further contributions were therefore due to the Vodafone UK plan for the period to 31 March 2016. The next valuation, which is being performed as at 31 March 2016, wilt be completed during the 2017 financial year after which the position of the scheme will be reassessed.\\n\\n37\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n21. Post-employment benefits (continued)\\n\\nThe Vodafone Section of the Vodafone UK plan covers a number of UK based employers within the Vodafone Group. Individual companies’ contribution, including the impact of any surplus or deficit overall within the scheme, have been accounted by each company in the same proportion since 31 March 2010, when the plan closed to future accrual, based on members employed in the company at that time.\\n\\nThe Company also operates the THUS Group plc Pension Scheme and two further small schemes.\\n\\nThe funding policies for these schemes are reviewed on a systematic basis in consultation with the independent scheme actuaries in order to ensure that the funding contributions from sponsoring employers are appropriate to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term.\\n\\nDefined contribution pension schemes\\n\\nDefined contribution pension costs charged to the Income Statement were £50.4m (2015: £43.4m).

      "The overall strategy of Vodafone Limited (\"the Company”) is aligned to that of Vodafone Group Plc (“the Group”), which is outlined in the Group Strategy Review in the Group's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2016, which does not form part of this report.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Company has transitioned to FRS 101 — Reduced Disclosure Framework for the preparation of these financial statements. Comparative information has been restated as appropriate; see note 1 to the financial statements for the impact of the adoption and the quantification of the historical adjustments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key financial performance indicators for the Company include revenue, operating loss and average revenue per user (“ARPU”). Other non-financial key performance indicators include 4G coverage and 4G customer growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Total revenue declined 1.8%. An improving trend in fixed line enterprise revenue was offset by a slowdown in mobile. The period under review also saw the launch of the Company's Consumer Broadband proposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mobile contract customer growth slowed in the last quarter, impacted partly by higher churn reflecting operational challenges following a billing system migration. Mobile revenue was also impacted by the pricing and usage of O8XX numbers following the introduction of Non-Geographic Call Services regulation and a focus on giving customers more control of their out-of-bundle data spend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outdoor 4G coverage reached 84% at 31 March 2016 (March 2015: 63%), or 91% based on the OFCOM definition, and the Company had 7.0 million 4G customers at the year end, up from 3.0 million at the prior year end. Contract ARPU reduced in the year to £26.50 (2015: £27.20) for reasons noted above.\n",
      "\n",
      "An operating loss of £354.8m (2015: £308.9m loss) was incurred during the year.\n",

      "The Statement of Financial Position on page 11 of the financial statements shows the Company's overall financial position at the end of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "In March 2016, the Company repaid the loan note through the issue of new share capital to the immediate parent at a premium of £6.3bn. This will reduce the Company's annual interest expense by over €300m going ‘forward. The major source of liquidity for the Company comes from the cash generated from trading activities. The Group treasury function provides a centralised treasury service to the Company, including managing its cash flow risks and follows a framework of policies and guidelines authorised and-reviewed annually by the Group's management.\n",

Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting if the following two conditions are met; (i) the deliverable has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and (ii) there is evidence of the fair value of the item. The arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on its relative fair value. Revenue allocated to deliverables is restricted to the amount that is receivable without the delivery of additional goods or services. This restriction typically applies to revenue recognised for devices provided to customers, including handsets.\n",

Charges are negotiated separately and are subject to continual review. Revenue generated through the provision of these services is accounted for gross of any amounts payable to other telecommunications operators for interconnect fees. in certain instances the Company uses estimates to determine the amount of income receivable, and these estimates may be subject to retrospective adjustment. These estimates are periodically adjusted to reflect actual pricing or usage, the adjustments being recognised in the year in which they are made.\n",

Review of the business and future developments\\n\\nThe overall strategy of Vodafone Limited (\"the Company”) is aligned to that of Vodafone Group Plc (“the Group”), which is outlined in the Group Strategy Review in the Group\\'s Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2016, which does not form part of this report.\\n\\nThe Company has transitioned to FRS 101 — Reduced Disclosure Framework for the preparation of these financial statements. Comparative information has been restated as appropriate; see note 1 to the financial statements for the impact of the adoption and the quantification of the historical adjustments.\\n\\nKey financial performance indicators for the Company include revenue, operating loss and average revenue per user (“ARPU”). Other non-financial key performance indicators include 4G coverage and 4G customer growth.\\n\\nTotal revenue declined 1.8%. An improving trend in fixed line enterprise revenue was offset by a slowdown in mobile. The period under review also saw the launch of the Company\\'s Consumer Broadband proposition.\\n\\nMobile contract customer growth slowed in the last quarter, impacted partly by higher churn reflecting operational challenges following a billing system migration. Mobile revenue was also impacted by the pricing and usage of O8XX numbers following the introduction of Non-Geographic Call Services regulation and a focus on giving customers more control of their out-of-bundle data spend.\\n\\nOutdoor 4G coverage reached 84% at 31 March 2016 (March 2015: 63%), or 91% based on the OFCOM definition, and the Company had 7.0 million 4G customers at the year end, up from 3.0 million at the prior year end. Contract ARPU reduced in the year to £26.50 (2015: £27.20) for reasons noted above.\\n\\nAn operating loss of £354.8m (2015: £308.9m loss) was incurred during the year.\\n\\nThe key goals for the year ahead are to stabilise customer operations after the billing system migration, further focus our investment in network assets and continue our drive on cost efficiency.\\n\\nFinancial position and liquidity\\n\\nThe Statement of Financial Position on page 11 of the financial statements shows the Company\\'s overall financial position at the end of the year.\\n\\nIn March 2016, the Company repaid the loan note through the issue of new share capital to the immediate parent at a premium of £6.3bn. This will reduce the Company\\'s annual interest expense by over €300m going ‘forward. The major source of liquidity for the Company comes from the cash generated from trading activities. The Group treasury function provides a centralised treasury service to the Company, including managing its cash flow risks and follows a framework of policies and guidelines authorised and-reviewed annually by the Group\\'s management.\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED Company No: 01471587 STRATEGIC REPORT (continued)\\n\\nFinancial position and liquidity (continued)\\n\\nThe Company closed the. year with cash of £19.0m (2015: €63.3m); excess funds are loaned to the Vodafone Group under cash sweep arrangements. For further details of current and long term amounts payable to and due from the parent company and fellow subsidiary undertakings, see notes 12, 13 and 14 of the financial statements.\\n\\nOn the basis of their assessment of the Company\\'s financial position, the factors likely to affect its future development and performance, and the enquiries made of the Directors of Vodafone Group Plc, who is its ultimate parent, the Company\\'s Directors have no reason to believe that a material uncertainty exists that may cast doubt about the ability of the Vodafone Group Plc to continue as a going concern. Accordingly they expect that the Company will be able to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and hence continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements. Going concern is discussed in note 1 to the financial statements.\\n\\nPrincipal risks and uncertainties\\n\\nThe Company has a clear framework for identifying and managing risk, both at an operational and strategic level. The Company has a dedicated Risk and Compliance team that coordinates risk management across the Company’s business, alongside an established Risk and Compliance Committee that is made up of members of the Company\\'s General Management Team.\\n\\nThe principal risks and uncertainties for the Company and mitigating factors are as follows:\\n\\na) _ Risk; Failure to protect customer information We host increasing quantities and types of customer data in both enterprise and consumer segments. Hardware and software applications include security features which are reviewed by our technology and corporate security functions to ensure compliance with our policies and security standards.\\n\\n5) Risk: Malicious Cyber Attack We recognise the increasing threat of malicious data loss or outages as a consequence of cyber-crime. This is mitigated by continuous monitoring of our IT infrastructure to identify threats and potential areas of weaknesses.\\n\\n©) Risk: Significant Outage to our Network or IT Systems Major failure or malicious attack on our network or IT systems may result in service interruption and consequential customer and revenue loss. Specific back-up and resilience requirements are built into our networks combined with regularly tested business continuity and disaster recovery plans.\\n\\n@ Risk: Key suppliers We depend on a limited number of suppliers for strategically important network and IT infrastructure and associated support services to operate and upgrade our networks and provide key services to our customers. We periodically review the performance of key suppliers, including identifying and managing y suppliers at risk” and having business continuity plans in case of supplier failure.\\n\\nDirector Date: 9 September 2016\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED Company No: 01471587 REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS\\n\\nThe directors present their report and the audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2016. :\\n\\nLoss and dividends\\n\\nFor the year ended 31 March 2016, the Company reported a loss for the financial year of £658.2m (2015: £536.9m loss).

The accounting policies adopted in respect of material items are described below. The accounting policies have been applied on a consistent basis during the current and the preceding year, following the adoption of FRS 101 as described in note 24 of these financial statements.\\n\\nBasis of preparation\\n\\nThese financial statements were prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (“FRS 101”), and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The amendments to FRS 101 (2013/14 cycle) issued in July 2014 and effective immediately have been applied.\\n\\nIn preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.\\n\\nThe Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (FRS 100) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. Accordingly, for the year ended 31 March 2016, the Company has changed its accounting framework from UK GAAP to FRS 101 as issued by the Financial Reporting Council and has, in doing so, applied the requirements of IFRS 1.6-33 and related appendices. The prior year financial statements were restated for material adjustments on adoption of FRS 101 as set out in the notes to the financial statements. Refer to note 24.\\n\\nThe Company is exempt by virtue of section 400 of the Companies Act 2006 from the requirement to prepare group financial statements.

The Directors have also considered the financial position of the Company\\'s ultimate parent Vodafone Group Plc, including centralised treasury arrangements.\\n\\nOn the basis of their assessment of the Company\\'s financial position and of the enquiries made of the Directors of Vodafone Group Plc, the Company\\'s Directors have no reason to believe that a material uncertainty exists that may cast doubt about the ability of the Vodafone Group Plc to continue as a going concern. Accordingly they expect that the Company will be able to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and hence continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.\\n\\n14\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\n\\nThe accounting policies that materially impact the financial statement are as follows:\\n\\nRevenue recognition\\n\\nRevenue, which excludes sales taxes, results from sale of telecommunications services and equipment to customers. In respect of the mobile services this includes monthly access charges, airtime usage, messaging and handset sales. In respect of the fixed line services this includes fixed line telecommunications services including data and voice services and the sale of equipment.\\n\\nAccess charges and airtime used by contract customers are invoiced and recorded as part of a periodic billing cycle and recognised as revenue over the related access period. Revenue from the sale of prepaid credit is deferred until such time as the customer uses the airtime, or the credit expires.\\n\\nFor equipment sales made to intermediaries, revenue is recognised if the significant risks associated with the equipment are transferred to the intermediary and the intermediary has no general right of return. If the significant risks are not transferred, revenue recognition is deferred until sale of the handset to an end customer by the intermediary or the expiry of the right of return.\\n\\nIn revenue arrangements including more than one deliverable, the arrangements are divided into separate units of accounting. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting if the following two conditions are met; (i) the deliverable has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and (ii) there is evidence of the fair value of the item. The arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on its relative fair value. Revenue allocated to deliverables is restricted to the amount that is receivable without the delivery of additional goods or services. This restriction typically applies to revenue recognised for devices provided to customers, including handsets.\\n\\nAmounts payable by telecommunications operators for interconnection and transmission of content are recognised as the services are provided. Charges are negotiated separately and are subject to continual review. Revenue generated through the provision of these services is accounted for gross of any amounts payable to other telecommunications operators for interconnect fees. in certain instances the Company uses estimates to determine the amount of income receivable, and these estimates may be subject to retrospective adjustment. These estimates are periodically adjusted to reflect actual pricing or usage, the adjustments being recognised in the year in which they are made.\\n\\nRevenue from data services and information provision is recognised when the Company has performed the related service and, depending on the nature of the service, is recognised either at the gross amount billed to the customer or the amount receivable by the Company as commission for facilitating the service.\\n\\n15\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED — NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\n\\nAcquisition and retention commissions\\n\\nIntermediaries are given cash incentives by the Company to connect new mobile customers and upgrade existing customers. Costs are recognised as an expense in cost of sales for the period in which they are incurred or where related to future performance, recognised in future periods on an accruals basis when contractual conditions have been satisfied.\\n\\nIntangible assets\\n\\nPurchased intangible assets, including licence fees, are capitalised at cost and stated at cost less amortisation and provision for impairment.\\n\\n(i)\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\n(iii)\\n\\nGoodwill\\n\\nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Company\\'s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity recognised at the date of acquisition.\\n\\nGoodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost tess any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not subject to amortisation, but is tested annually for impairment or whenever there is evidence that it may be required. Goodwill is denominated in the currency of the acquired entity and revalued to the closing exchange rate at each reporting period date.\\n\\nGoodwill arising before the date of transition to FRS101, on 1 April 2015, is recognised at the net book value prevailing at that date, subject to being tested for impairment. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.\\n\\nLicence fees\\n\\nLicence fees are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic life. The amortisation period for the Company\\'s 3G licence fees is 17.1 years. The amortisation period for the Company\\'s 4G licence fees is 20 years.\\n\\nComputer software\\n\\nCosts associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.\\n\\nDevelopment and acquisition costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable software products controlled by the Company are recognised as intangible assets.\\n\\nComputer software costs recognised as assets are amortised using the straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which does not exceed 5 years.\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n1, Statement of accounting policies (continued) Property, plant and equipment\\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairments.\\n\\nIncluded within the cost of network infrastructure systems are materials awaiting installation which are valued at cost less a provision for excess and obsolete items. The materials are used in the construction and maintenance of new and existing infrastructure and, when issued, are charged either to the cost of specific infrastructure or to the Income Statement.\\n\\nThe cost of property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in its acquisition and installation.\\n\\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment\\n\\nDepreciation is not provided on freehold land. Depreciation of plant and equipment is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than assets under construction, to their residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated usefut lives, as follows:\\n\\nFreehold buildings 40-50 years Leasehold improvements 5-40 years Plant and machinery 1-7 years Motor vehicles 4 years Furniture and fittings 5-10 years Network infrastructure 5-40 years Investments\\n\\nInvestments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value. The performance of investments is reviewed annually at each year end to establish whether there has been a impairment in the value of the investment which would necessitate a provision.\\n\\nAsset impairment\\n\\nIntangible assets and property, plant and equipment that are subject to amortisation are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where an impairment indicator is identified, the carrying value of the income generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount. Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value an impairment is recognised. :\\n\\nAn impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.\\n\\nInventory\\n\\nInventory is valued at the Lower of cost and estimated net realisable value. Provision is made where inventory is slow moving or obsolete to reduce cost to its net realisable value, calculated with reference to historic sales experience and forecast demand. .\\n\\n17\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\n\\nLeases\\n\\nRental costs under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement in equal annual amounts over the periods of the leases.\\n\\nAssets acquired under finance leases, which transfer substantially all the rights and obligations of ownership, are accounted for as though purchased outright. The fair value of the asset at the inception of the lease is included in property, plant and equipment and the capital element of the leasing commitment included in creditors. Finance charges are calculated on an actuarial basis and are allocated over each lease to produce a constant rate of charge on the outstanding balance.\\n\\nTaxation\\n\\nCurrent tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\\n\\nDeferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those which are included in financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\\n\\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period and adjusted to reflect changes in the Company\\'s assessment that sufficient taxable profits will be available within the UK tax group to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\\n\\nForeign currencies -\\n\\nTransactions in currencies other than the Company\\'s reporting currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate prevailing on the date when fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange. differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the Income Statement for the period.\\n\\nJoint operations\\n\\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, retating to the arrangement or that other facts and circumstances indicate that this is the case. The Company\\'s share of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows are combined with the equivalent items in the financial statements on a line-by-line basis. :\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n1, Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\n\\nPensions\\n\\nThe Company participates in both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.\\n\\n(i)\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nDefined benefit pension schemes\\n\\nThe asset or deficit recognised in the Statement of Financial Position in respect of the defined benefit plan represents the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligations at the reporting date. Net plan assets are recognised only to the extent that the present value of the economic benefit is available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Defined benefit obligations for the scheme are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the Projected unit method. The present value of these obligations is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid. The bonds used have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligation.\\n\\nThe Company recognises actuarial gains and losses, arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions, in the period in which they occur in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the Income Statement, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employee remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In these cases, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\\n\\nCurrent service costs and any past service costs, together with the unwinding of the discount on plan liabilities less the expected return on plan assets, are included within operating costs.\\n\\nDefined contribution pension schemes\\n\\nFor defined contribution schemes, the Company pays contributions to independently administered funds. The Company has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.\\n\\nDefined contribution pension costs charged to the Income Statement represent contributions payable in respect of the year.\\n\\nFinancial assets\\n\\nThe Company classifies its financial assets under loans and receivables: Non-derivative financial assets with “fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. The Company\\'s loans and receivables comprise receivables and cash. The Company has no financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.\\n\\nTrade and other receivables mainly consist of amounts owed to us by customers, fellow group undertakings and amounts that we pay to our suppliers in advance. Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based on the ageing of the receivable balances and historical experience. Individual trade receivables are written off when management deems them not to be collectable.\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued) Borrowings\\n\\nInterest bearing loans are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to cost at inception), and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, except where they are identified as a hedged item in a designated hedge relationship. Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the amount due on settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowing.\\n\\nCreditors\\n\\nCreditors are obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. ,\\n\\nCreditors are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.\\n\\nShare-based payments\\n\\nThe Vodafone Group Plc issues equity-settled share awards to certain of the Company’s employees. Equity- settled share-based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company\\'s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. Fair value is measured using a binomial pricing model which is calibrated using a Black-Scholes option pricing framework. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management\\'s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioral considerations.\\n\\nWhere the Vodafone Group Plc grants rights or share options over its shares to employees of the Company, the Company records this as a capital contribution directly in equity. Where the Company makes cash payments to its ultimate parent in respect of any rights or share options granted, such cash contributions are accounted for as a reduction in the capital contribution received (see note 20).\\n\\nFinance costs Finance costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred. Provisions\\n\\nProvisions for asset restoration obligations, restructuring costs and other claims are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre- tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specific to the obligation.\\n\\n20\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued) Critical accounting estimates and judgements\\n\\nEstimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\\n\\nThe Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.\\n\\n(a) Revenue recognition @) Arrangements with multiple deliverables\\n\\nIn revenue arrangements where more than one good or service is provided to the customer, customer consideration is allocated between the goods and services using relative fair value principles. The fair values determined for deliverables may impact the timing of the recognition of revenue.\\n\\nDetermining the fair value of each deliverable can require complex estimates. The Company generally determines the fair value of individual elements based on prices at which the deliverable is regularly sold on a stand-alone basis after considering any appropriate volume discounts.\\n\\n(ii) Gross versus net presentation\\n\\nWhen the Company sells goods or services as a principal, income and payments to suppliers are reported on a gross basis in revenue and operating costs. If the Company sells goods or services as an agent, revenue and payments to suppliers are recorded in revenue on a net basis, representing the margin earned. Whether the Company is considered to be the principal or an agent in the transaction depends on analysis by management of both the legal form and substance of the agreement between the Company and its business partners; such judgements impact the amount of reported revenue and operating expenses but do not impact reported assets, liabilities or cash flows.\\n\\n(b) Taxation\\n\\nThe Company\\'s tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges. The calculation of the Company\\'s total tax charge involves estimation and judgement in respect of certain matters where the tax impact is uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax authority or through a Legal process. The final resolution of some of these items, which can take many years, may give rise to material profits, losses and/or cash flows.\\n\\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets, particularly in respect of tax losses, is based upon whether it is probable that there will be sufficient and suitable taxable profits in the Company or the UK tax group against which to utilise the assets in the future. .\\n\\nJudgement is required when determining probable future taxable profits. The Company assesses the availability of future taxable profits using the same undiscounted five year forecasts for the Company\\'s operations as are used in the Group’s value in use calculations. Where tax losses are forecast to be recovered beyond the five year period, the availability of taxable profits is assessed using the cash flows and long-term growth rates used for the vatue in use calculations.\\n\\n21\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\n\\n(b) Taxation (continued)\\n\\n(c\\n\\n~~\\n\\nChanges in the assumptions which underpin the Company\\'s forecasts could have an impact on the amount of future taxable profits and could have a significant impact on the period over which the deferred tax asset would be recovered.\\n\\nThe Company only considers substantively enacted tax laws when assessing the amount and availability of tax Losses to offset against the future taxable profits. See note 7 “Income tax on ordinary activities”.\\n\\nFinite lived intangible assets\\n\\nOther intangible assets include amounts spent by the Company acquiring investments, licences fees and the costs of purchasing and developing computer software.\\n\\nWhere intangible assets are acquired through business combinations and no active market for the assets exists, the fair value of these assets is determined by discounting estimated future net cash flows generated by the asset. Estimates relating to the future cash flows and discount rates used may have a material effect on the reported amounts of finite lived intangible assets.\\n\\nThe useful life over which intangible assets are amortised depends on management\\'s estimate of the period over which economic benefit will be derived from the asset. Reducing the useful life will increase the amortisation charge in the Income Statement. Useful lives are periodically reviewed to ensure that they remain appropriate. The basis for determining the useful life for the most significant categories of intangible assets is discussed below.\\n\\nThe estimated useful life of licence fees is generally the term of the licence unless there is a presumption of renewal at negligible cost; this is adjusted if necessary, for example taking into account the impact of any expected changes in technology.\\n\\nThe useful life of software is based on management\\'s view, considering historical experience with similar products as well as anticipation of future events which may impact their life such as changes | in technology. The useful life will not exceed the duration of the licence.\\n\\n(d) Property, plant and equipment\\n\\nProperty, plant and equipment represents 25.9% (2015: 23.9%) of the Company\\'s total assets; estimates and assumptions made may have a material impact on their carrying value and related depréciation charge. See note 9 “Property, plant and equipment.\\n\\nThe depreciation charge for an asset is derived using estimates of its expected useful life and expected residual value, which are reviewed annually. Increasing an asset\\'s expected life or residual value would result in a reduced depreciation charge in the Income Statement. Management determines the useful tives and residual values for assets when they are acquired, based on experience with similar assets and taking into account other relevant factors such as any expected changes in technology. The useful life of network infrastructure is assumed not to exceed the duration of related operating licences unless there is a reasonable expectation of renewal or an alternative future use for the asset.\\n\\n22\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\n\\n(e) Post-employment benefits\\n\\niC)\\n\\n~\\n\\nManagement judgement is exercised when determining the Company\\'s liabilities and expenses arising for defined benefit pension schemes. Management is required to make assumptions regarding future rates of inflation, salary increases, discount rates and longevity of members, each of which may have a material impact on the defined benefit obligations that are recorded. Further details, including a sensitivity analysis, are included in note 21 “Post-employment benefits”.\\n\\nImpairment reviews\\n\\nIFRS requires management to perform impairment tests annually for indefinite lived assets and, for finite lived assets, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\\n\\nImpairment testing requires management to judge whether the carrying value of assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows that they generate. Calculating the net present value of the future cash flows requires assumptions to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters including management\\'s expectations of:\\n\\ne — Growth in EBITDA, calculated as adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation; ¢ — Timing and amount of future capital expenditure, licence and spectrum payments;\\n\\n© — Long-term growth rates; and\\n\\n¢ — Appropriate discount rates to reflect the risks involved.\\n\\nManagement prepares formal five year forecasts for the Company\\'s operations, which are used to\\n\\nestimate their value in use. ~\\n\\nChanging the assumptions selected by management, in particular the discount rate and growth rate assumptions used in the cash flow projection, could significantly affect the Company\\'s impairment evaluation and hence reported assets and profits or losses.\\n\\nProvisions\\n\\nThe Company exercises judgement in measuring and recognising provisions. A provision is determined based on the best estimate of amounts required to settle the obligation taking into account all available information. Given the uncertainties inherent in the estimates used to determine the amount of the provision, actual outflow of resources may differ from the amounts recognised originally on the basis of the estimates.\\n\\n23\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n2.

A further reduction in the UK corporation tax rate was announced in the 2016 Finance Bill to further reduce the tax rate to 17% (to be effective from 1° April 2020).\\n\\nThis further rate reduction was not substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date. Therefore the rate of 18% (2015: 20%) has been used to calculate the deferred tax asset/(liability), with an adjustment being made for the expected movement in the asset/(liability) at the 19% rate during the years ended 31 March 2017, 31 March 2018, 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2020.\\n\\nAn amount of £98.0m (2015: £3.5m) was charged to the Income Statement in respect of this rate reduction.\\n\\nThe standard rate of tax for the year, based on the UK standard rate of corporation tax, is 20% (2015: 21%).

Share-based payments\\n\\nThe Company currently uses a number of equity-settled share plans to grant options and shares in Vodafone Group Plc, the ultimate parent of the Company, to its directors and employees.\\n\\nThe Company has applied the exemption permitted by IFRS 2 that allows the measurement of this expense to be calculated only on share awards and share options granted after 7 November 2002. IFRS 2 requires that equity-settled share-based payments issued to the Company\\'s employees are measured at fair value and that this value is expensed over the vesting period, with an equivalent credit taken directly in equity as a capital contribution. On exercise of the shares by employees, the company is charged the intrinsic value of the share by Vodafone Group Ple. This amount is treated as a reduction of the capital contribution and is recognised directly in equity.\\n\\n35\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n20.

These options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant. The vesting of some of these options was subject to satisfaction of performance conditions.\\n\\nVodafone Group Sharesave Plan\\n\\nThe Vodafone Group 2008 Sharesave Plan and its predecessor, the Vodafone Group1998 Sharesave Scheme enables UK staff to acquire shares in Vodafone Group Plc through monthly savings of up to £250 over a three or five year period, at the end of which they also receive a tax free bonus. The savings and bonus may then be used to purchase shares at the option price, which is set at the beginning of the invitation period and usually at a discount of 20% to the then prevailing market price of the shares.\\n\\n(ii) Share plans\\n\\nVodafone Group executive plans\\n\\nUnder the Vodafone Global Incentive Plan awards of shares are granted to directors and certain employees. The release of these shares is conditional upon continued employment and for some awards achievement of certain performance targets measured over a three year period.\\n\\nVodafone Share Incentive Plan\\n\\nThe Vodafone Share Incentive Plan enables staff to acquire shares in Vodafone Group Plc through monthly purchases of up to £125 per month or 5% of salary, whichever is lower. For each share purchased by the employee, Vodafone Group Pic provides a free matching share.\\n\\n36\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n21. Post-employment benefits\\n\\nThe Company\\'s pension plans are provided through both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements. Defined benefit schemes provide benefits based on the employees’ length of pensionable service and their final pensionable salary or other criteria. Defined contribution schemes offer employees individuat funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement. :\\n\\nDefined benefit plans\\n\\nThe defined benefit plans are administered by Trustee Boards that are legally separated from the Company. The Trustee Board of each pension fund consists of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Company. The Boards of the pension funds are required by law to act in the best interest of the plan participants and are responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment and contribution policies, and the governance of the fund.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s main defined benefit scheme is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (‘Vodafone UK plan’). There are two segregated sections of the Vodafone UK plan, the pre-existing assets and liabilities of the Vodafone UK plan in the Vodafone Section and the former Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan CCWWRP”) assets and liabilities, which were transferred into the Vodafone UK plan on 6 June 2014, in the CWW Section, with the CWWRP then being wound up. The pre-existing Vodafone UK plan and the former CWWRP plan closed to future accrual on 31 March 2010 and 30 November 2013 respectively. Until 30 November 2013 the CWRP allowed employees to accrue a pension at a rate of 1/85th of their final salary for each year of service until the retirement age of 60 with a maximum pension of two thirds of final salary. Employees contributed 5% of their salary into the scheme.\\n\\n_ The Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HMRC and is subject to UK legislation and oversight from the Pensions Regulator. UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and that valuations are undertaken at least every three years. Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section. Within 15 months of each vatuation date, the plan trustees and the Company must agree any contributions required to ensure that the plan is fully funded over time on a suitably prudent measure.\\n\\nThe most recent valuations for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section of the Vodafone UK plan were carried out as at 31 March 2013 by independent actuaries appointed by the plan trustees. These valuations revealed a total deficit of £437 million on the schemes’ funding basis. Following the valuation, the Company paid special one-off contributions totalling £279 million in April 2014 (€239 million into the Vodafone Section and £40 million into the CWW Section). These lump sum contributions represented accelerated funding amounts that would otherwise have been due over the period to 31 March 2020. No further contributions were therefore due to the Vodafone UK plan for the period to 31 March 2016. The next valuation, which is being performed as at 31 March 2016, wilt be completed during the 2017 financial year after which the position of the scheme will be reassessed.\\n\\n37\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n\\n21. Post-employment benefits (continued)\\n\\nThe Vodafone Section of the Vodafone UK plan covers a number of UK based employers within the Vodafone Group. Individual companies’ contribution, including the impact of any surplus or deficit overall within the scheme, have been accounted by each company in the same proportion since 31 March 2010, when the plan closed to future accrual, based on members employed in the company at that time.\\n\\nThe Company also operates the THUS Group plc Pension Scheme and two further small schemes.\\n\\nThe funding policies for these schemes are reviewed on a systematic basis in consultation with the independent scheme actuaries in order to ensure that the funding contributions from sponsoring employers are appropriate to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term.\\n\\nDefined contribution pension schemes\\n\\nDefined contribution pension costs charged to the Income Statement were £50.4m (2015: £43.4m).

      "The accounting policies that materially impact the financial statement are as follows:\n",

      "Revenue recognition\n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue, which excludes sales taxes, results from sale of telecommunications services and equipment to customers. In respect of the mobile services this includes monthly access charges, airtime usage, messaging and handset sales. In respect of the fixed line services this includes fixed line telecommunications services including data and voice services and the sale of equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Access charges and airtime used by contract customers are invoiced and recorded as part of a periodic billing cycle and recognised as revenue over the related access period. Revenue from the sale of prepaid credit is deferred until such time as the customer uses the airtime, or the credit expires.\n",
      "\n",
      "For equipment sales made to intermediaries, revenue is recognised if the significant risks associated with the equipment are transferred to the intermediary and the intermediary has no general right of return. If the significant risks are not transferred, revenue recognition is deferred until sale of the handset to an end customer by the intermediary or the expiry of the right of return.\n",
      "\n",
      "In revenue arrangements including more than one deliverable, the arrangements are divided into separate units of accounting. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting if the following two conditions are met; (i) the deliverable has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and (ii) there is evidence of the fair value of the item. The arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on its relative fair value. Revenue allocated to deliverables is restricted to the amount that is receivable without the delivery of additional goods or services. This restriction typically applies to revenue recognised for devices provided to customers, including handsets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amounts payable by telecommunications operators for interconnection and transmission of content are recognised as the services are provided. Charges are negotiated separately and are subject to continual review. Revenue generated through the provision of these services is accounted for gross of any amounts payable to other telecommunications operators for interconnect fees. in certain instances the Company uses estimates to determine the amount of income receivable, and these estimates may be subject to retrospective adjustment.

The pre-existing Vodafone UK plan and the former CWWRP plan closed to future accrual on 31 March 2010 and 30 November 2013 respectively. Until 30 November 2013 the CWRP allowed employees to accrue a pension at a rate of 1/85th of their final salary for each year of service until the retirement age of 60 with a maximum pension of two thirds of final salary. Employees contributed 5% of their salary into the scheme.\n",

      "_ The Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HMRC and is subject to UK legislation and oversight from the Pensions Regulator. UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and that valuations are undertaken at least every three years. Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section. Within 15 months of each vatuation date, the plan trustees and the Company must agree any contributions required to ensure that the plan is fully funded over time on a suitably prudent measure.\n",

      "The most recent valuations for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section of the Vodafone UK plan were carried out as at 31 March 2013 by independent actuaries appointed by the plan trustees. These valuations revealed a total deficit of £437 million on the schemes’ funding basis. Following the valuation, the Company paid special one-off contributions totalling £279 million in April 2014 (€239 million into the Vodafone Section and £40 million into the CWW Section). These lump sum contributions represented accelerated funding amounts that would otherwise have been due over the period to 31 March 2020. No further contributions were therefore due to the Vodafone UK plan for the period to 31 March 2016. The next valuation, which is being performed as at 31 March 2016, wilt be completed during the 2017 financial year after which the position of the scheme will be reassessed.\n",
