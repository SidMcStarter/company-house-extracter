Comparative information has been restated as appropriate; see note 1 to the financial\\nstatements for the impact of the adoption and the quantification of the historical adjustments.\\nKey financial performance indicators for the Company include revenue, operating loss and average revenue per\\nuser (\"ARPU\"). Other non-financial key performance indicators include 4G coverage and 4G customer growth.\\nTotal revenue declined 1.8%. An improving trend in fixed line enterprise revenue was offset by a slowdown in\\nmobile. The period under review also saw the launch of the Company\\'s Consumer Broadband proposition.\\nMobile contract customer growth slowed in the last quarter, impacted partly by higher churn reflecting\\noperational challenges following a billing system migration. Mobile revenue was also impacted by the pricing\\nand usage of 08XX numbers following the introduction of Non-Geographic Call Services regulation and a focus\\non giving customers more control of their out-of-bundle data spend.\\nOutdoor 4G coverage reached 84% at 31 March 2016 (March 2015: 63%), or 91% based on the OFCOM\\ndefinition, and the Company had 7.0 million 4G customers at the year end, up from 3.0 million at the prior year\\nend. Contract ARPU reduced in the year to €26.50 (2015: £27.20) for reasons noted above.\\nAn operating loss of £354.8m (2015: £308.9m loss) was incurred during the year.\\nThe key goals for the year ahead are to stabilise customer operations after the billing system migration, further\\nfocus our investment in network assets and continue our drive on cost efficiency.\\nFinancial position and liquidity\\nThe Statement of Financial Position on page 11 of the financial statements shows the Company\\'s overall\\nfinancial position at the end of the year.\\nIn March 2016, the Company repaid the loan note through the issue of new share capital to the immediate\\nparent at a premium of £6.3bn. This will reduce the Company\\'s annual interest expense by over £300m going\\nforward. The major source of liquidity for the Company comes from the cash generated from trading activities.\\nThe Group treasury function provides a centralised treasury service to the Company, including managing its\\ncash flow risks and follows a framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed annually by the\\nGroup\\'s management.\\n1\\n\\n--- End of Page 1 ---\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED\\nCompany No: 01471587\\nSTRATEGIC REPORT (continued)\\nFinancial position and liquidity (continued)\\nThe Company closed the year with cash of £19.0m (2015: £63.3m); excess funds are loaned to the Vodafone\\nGroup under cash sweep arrangements. For further details of current and long term amounts payable to and\\ndue from the parent company and fellow subsidiary undertakings, see notes 12, 13 and 14 of the financial\\nstatements.\\nOn the basis of their assessment of the Company\\'s financial position, the factors likely to affect its future\\ndevelopment and performance, and the enquiries made of the Directors of Vodafone Group Plc, who is its\\nultimate parent, the Company\\'s Directors have no reason to believe that a material uncertainty exists that may\\ncast doubt about the ability of the Vodafone Group Plc to continue as a going concern. Accordingly they expect\\nthat the Company will be able to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and hence\\ncontinue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements. Going\\nconcern is discussed in note 1 to the financial statements.\\nPrincipal risks and uncertainties\\nThe Company has a clear framework for identifying and managing risk, both at an operational and strategic\\nlevel. The Company has a dedicated Risk and Compliance team that coordinates risk management across the\\nCompany\\'s business, alongside an established Risk and Compliance Committee that is made up of members of\\nthe Company\\'s General Management Team.\\nThe principal risks and uncertainties for the Company and mitigating factors are as follows:\\n) Risk: Failure to protect customer information\\nWe host increasing quantities and types of customer data in both enterprise and consumer segments.\\nHardware and software applications include security features which are reviewed by our technology and\\ncorporate security functions to ensure compliance with our policies and security standards\\nb)\\nRisk: Malicious Cyber Attack\\nWe recognise the increasing threat of malicious data loss or outages as a consequence of cyber-crime. This\\nis mitigated by continuous monitoring of our IT infrastructure to identify threats and potential areas of\\nweaknesses\\n) Risk: Significant Outage to our Network or IT Systems\\nMajor failure or malicious attack on our network or IT systems may result in service interruption and\\nconsequential customer and revenue loss. Specific back-up and resilience requirements are built into our\\nnetworks combined with regularly tested business continuity and disaster recovery plans.\\nd)\\nRisk: Key suppliers\\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for strategically important network and IT infrastructure and\\nassociated support services to operate and upgrade our networks and provide key services to our\\ncustomers. We periodically review the performance of key suppliers, including identifying and managing\\n\"\"suppliers at risk\" and having business continuity plans in case of supplier failure.\\nRHere\\nDirector\\nDate: 9 September 2016\\n2\\n\\n--- End of Page 1 ---\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED\\nCompany No: 01471587\\nREPORT OF THE DIRECTORS\\nThe directors present their report and the audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31\\nMarch 2016.\\nLoss and dividends\\nFor the year ended 31 March 2016, the Company reported a loss for the financial year of £658.2m (2015:\\n£536.9m loss).

An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts\\nand disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free\\nfrom material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:\\n. whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company\\'s circumstances and have been consistently\\napplied and adequately disclosed;\\n· the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and\\n.. the overall presentation of the financial statements.\\n\\'We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors\\' judgements against available evidence, forming our\\nown judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.\\nWe test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to\\nprovide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of\\ncontrols, substantive procedures or a combination of both.\\nIn addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies\\nwith the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or\\nmaterially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of\\nany apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.\\nFiona Dotal(Senior Statutory Auditor)\\nfor and on behalf of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,\\nChartered Accountants and Statutory Auditor\\nLondon\\nDate: 9 September 2016\\n8\\n\\n--- End of Page 1 ---\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED\\nINCOME STATEMENT\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\nNotes\\n2016\\n2015\\n£m\\n£m\\nRevenue\\n2\\n6,183.5\\n6,294.2\\nCost of sales\\n(4,739.4)\\n(4,870.3)\\nGross profit\\n1,444.1\\n1,423.9\\nSelling and distribution costs\\n(705.5)\\n(681.5)\\nAdministrative expenses\\n(1,093.4)\\n(1,051.3)\\nOperating loss\\n3\\n(354.8)\\n(308.9)\\nLoss on disposal of investment\\n(16.1)\\nFinance costs\\n6\\n(282.0)\\n(296.0)\\nLoss on ordinary activities before taxation\\n(636.8)\\n(621.0)\\nIncome tax on ordinary activities\\n7\\n(21.4)\\n84.1\\nLoss for the financial year\\n(658.2)\\n(536.9)\\nThe results above are derived from continuing operations.\\nThe accompanying notes on pages 13 to 48 are an integral part of these financial statements.\\n9\\n\\n--- End of Page 1 ---\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED\\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\nNotes\\n2016\\n2015\\n£m\\n£m\\nLoss for the financial year\\n(658.2)\\n(536.9)\\nOther comprehensive income/(expense): Items that will not be\\nreclassified to profit or loss:\\nActuarial gain/(loss) in the value of defined benefit retirement\\nplans\\n21\\n101.7\\n(85.3)\\nDeferred tax attributable to actuarial gains and losses\\n16\\n(18.4)\\n.17.0\\nOther comprehensive income/(expense)\\n83.3\\n(68.3)\\nTotal comprehensive loss for the financial year\\n(574.9)\\n(605.2)\\nThe accompanying notes on pages 13 to 48 are an integral part of these financial statements.\\n10\\n\\n--- End of Page 1 ---\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED\\nSTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\\nAS AT 31 MARCH 2016\\nCompany No: 01471587\\nNote\\n2016\\n2015\\n£m\\n£m\\nFixed assets\\nIntangible assets\\n8\\n3,693.2\\n3,984.5\\nProperty, plant and equipment\\n9\\n3,267.1\\n3,174.6\\nInvestments\\n10\\n25.1\\n25.\\nPost-employment benefits\\n21\\n173.2\\n165.7\\n7,158.6\\n7,349.9\\nCurrent assets\\nInventory\\n11\\n102.8\\n88.9\\nTrade and other receivables\\n12\\n4,486.3\\n4,853.3\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n19.0\\n63.3\\nDeferred tax asset\\n16\\n859.4\\n.948.5\\n5,467.5\\n5,954.0\\nCreditors: amounts falling due within one year\\n13\\n(5,079.2)\\n(5,175.0)\\nNET CURRENT ASSETS\\n388.3\\n779.0\\nTOTAL ASSETS LESS CURRENT LIABILITIES\\n7,546.9\\n8,128.9\\nCreditors: amounts falling due after more than one year\\n14\\n(23.1)\\n(6,290.6)\\nProvisions for liabilities\\n15\\n(226.7)\\n(243.5)\\nPost-employment benefits\\n21\\n(97.7)\\n(184.4)\\nNET ASSETS\\n7,199.4\\n1,410.4\\nEQUITY\\nOrdinary shares\\n17\\nShare premium account\\n8,974.1\\n2,605.2\\nRetained earnings deficit\\n(1,774.7)\\n(1,194.8)\\nTOTAL SHAREHOLDERS\\' FUNDS\\n7,199.4\\n1,410.4\\nThe financial statements on pages 9 to 48 were approved and authorised for issue by the directors on\\n9 September 2016 and were signed on its behalf by:\\nPAviere\\n11\\n\\n--- End of Page 1 ---\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED\\nSTATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\nCompany No: 01471587\\nShare\\nTotal\\nCalled up share\\npremium\\nRetained\\nShareholders\\ncapital\\naccount\\nearnings\\nfunds\\nNote\\n£m\\nEm\\n£m\\n£m\\nBalance at 1 April 2014\\n2,605.2\\n(584.6)\\n2,020.6\\nLoss for the financial year\\n(536.9)\\n(536.9)\\nOther comprehensive expense\\n(68.3)\\n(68.3)\\nTotal comprehensive expense for the financial\\n(605.2)\\n(605.2)\\nyear\\nShare based payment recharge\\n20\\n(5.0)\\n(5.0)\\nBalance at 31 March 2015\\n2,605.2\\n(1,194.8)\\n1,410.4\\nLoss for the financial year\\n(658.2)\\n(658.2)\\nOther comprehensive income\\n83.3\\n83.3\\nTotal comprehensive expense for the financial\\nyear\\n(574.9)\\n(574.9)\\nShare based payment recharge\\n20\\n(5.0)\\n(5.0)\\nShare issues\\n17\\n6,368.9\\n6,368.9\\nBalance at 31 March 2016\\n8,974.1\\n(1,774.7)\\n7,199.4\\n12\\n\\n--- End of Page 1 ---\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n1.

Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\nThe accounting policies that materially impact the financial statement are as follows:\\nRevenue recognition\\nRevenue, which excludes sales taxes, results from sale of telecommunications services and equipment to\\ncustomers. In respect of the mobile services this includes monthly access charges, airtime usage, messaging\\nand handset sales. In respect of the fixed line services this includes fixed line telecommunications services\\nincluding data and voice services and the sale of equipment.\\nAccess charges and airtime used by contract customers are invoiced and recorded as part of a periodic billing\\ncycle and recognised as revenue over the related access period. Revenue from the sale of prepaid credit is\\ndeferred until such time as the customer uses the airtime, or the credit expires.\\nFor equipment sales made to intermediaries, revenue is recognised if the significant risks associated with the\\nequipment are transferred to the intermediary and the intermediary has no general right of return. If the\\nsignificant risks are not transferred, revenue recognition is deferred until sale of the handset to an end customer\\nby the intermediary or the expiry of the right of return.\\nIn revenue arrangements including more than one deliverable, the arrangements are divided into separate units\\nof accounting. Deliverables are considered separate units of accounting if the following two conditions are met;\\n(i) the deliverable has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and (ii) there is evidence of the fair value of\\nthe item. The arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on its relative\\nfair value. Revenue allocated to deliverables is restricted to the amount that is receivable without the delivery of\\nadditional goods or services. This restriction typically applies to revenue recognised for devices provided to\\ncustomers, including handsets.\\nAmounts payable by telecommunications operators for interconnection and transmission of content are\\nrecognised as the services are provided. Charges are negotiated separately and are subject to continual review.\\nRevenue generated through the provision of these services is accounted for gross of any amounts payable to\\nother telecommunications operators for interconnect fees. In certain instances the Company uses estimates to\\ndetermine the amount of income receivable, and these estimates may be subject to retrospective adjustment.\\nThese estimates are periodically adjusted to reflect actual pricing or usage, the adjustments being recognised in\\nthe year in which they are made\\nRevenue from data services and information provision is recognised when the Company has performed the\\nrelated service and, depending on the nature of the service, is recognised either at the gross amount billed to\\nthe customer or the amount receivable by the Company as commission for facilitating the service.\\n15\\n\\n--- End of Page 1 ---\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\nAcquisition and retention commissions\\nIntermediaries are given cash incentives by the Company to connect new mobile customers and upgrade\\nexisting customers. Costs are recognised as an expense in cost of sales for the period in which they are incurred\\nor where related to future performance, recognised in future periods on an accruals basis when contractual\\nconditions have been satisfied.\\nIntangible assets\\nPurchased intangible assets, including licence fees, are capitalised at cost and stated at cost less amortisation\\nand provision for impairment.\\n(i) Goodwill\\nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the\\nCompany\\'s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the\\nentity recognised at the date of acquisition.\\nGoodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any\\naccumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not subject to amortisation, but is tested annually for\\nimpairment or whenever there is evidence that it may be required. Goodwill is denominated in the\\ncurrency of the acquired entity and revalued to the closing exchange rate at each reporting period date.\\nGoodwill arising before the date of transition to FRS101, on 1 April 2015, is recognised at the net book\\nvalue prevailing at that date, subject to being tested for impairment. Goodwill written off to reserves under\\nUK GAAP has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on\\ndisposal.\\n(ii) Licence fees\\nLicence fees are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic\\nlife. The amortisation period for the Company\\'s 3G licence fees is 17.1 years. The amortisation period for\\nthe Company\\'s 4G licence fees is 20 years.\\n(iii) Computer software\\nCosts associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as\\nincurred.\\nDevelopment and acquisition costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable\\nsoftware products controlled by the Company are recognised as intangible assets\\nComputer software costs recognised as assets are amortised using the straight line basis over their\\nestimated useful lives, which does not exceed 5 years.\\n16\\n\\n--- End of Page 1 ---\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\nProperty, plant and equipment\\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for\\nimpairments.\\nIncluded within the cost of network infrastructure systems are materials awaiting installation which are valued\\nat cost less a provision for excess and obsolete items. The materials are used in the construction and\\nmaintenance of new and existing infrastructure and, when issued, are charged either to the cost of specific\\ninfrastructure or to the Income Statement.\\nThe cost of property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in its\\nacquisition and installation.\\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment\\nDepreciation is not provided on freehold land. Depreciation of plant and equipment is charged so as to write off\\nthe cost of assets, other than assets under construction, to their residual values using the straight-line method\\nover their estimated useful lives, as follows:\\nFreehold buildings\\n40-50 years\\nLeasehold improvements\\n5-40 years\\nPlant and machinery\\n1-7 years\\nMotor vehicles\\n4 years\\nFurniture and fittings\\n5-10 years\\nNetwork infrastructure\\n5-40 years\\nInvestments\\nInvestments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value. The performance\\nof investments is reviewed annually at each year end to establish whether there has been a impairment in the\\nvalue of the investment which would necessitate a provision.\\nAsset impairment\\nIntangible assets and property, plant and equipment that are subject to amortisation are reviewed whenever\\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where an\\nimpairment indicator is identified, the carrying value of the income generating unit is compared with its\\nrecoverable amount. Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value an impairment is\\nrecognised.\\nAn impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement for the amount by which the assets carrying amount\\nexceeds its recoverable amount.\\nInventory\\nInventory is valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value. Provision is made where inventory is\\nslow moving or obsolete to reduce cost to its net realisable value, calculated with reference to historic sales\\nexperience and forecast demand.\\n17\\n\\n--- End of Page 1 ---\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\nLeases\\nRental costs under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement in equal annual amounts over the\\nperiods of the leases.\\nAssets acquired under finance leases, which transfer substantially all the rights and obligations of ownership,\\nare accounted for as though purchased outright. The fair value of the asset at the inception of the lease is\\nincluded in property, plant and equipment and the capital element of the leasing commitment included in\\ncreditors. Finance charges are calculated on an actuarial basis and are allocated over each lease to produce a\\nconstant rate of charge on the outstanding balance.\\nTaxation\\nCurrent tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid, or\\nrecovered, using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet\\ndate\\nDeferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to\\npay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on\\ntax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Timing\\ndifferences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods\\ndifferent from those which are included in financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent\\nthat it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not\\ndiscounted.\\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period and adjusted to reflect changes\\nin the Company\\'s assessment that sufficient taxable profits will be available within the UK tax group to allow all\\nor part of the asset to be recovered.\\nForeign currencies\\nTransactions in currencies other than the Company\\'s reporting currency are recorded at the exchange rate\\nprevailing on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary items denominated in foreign\\ncurrencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items carried at fair\\nvalue that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate prevailing on the date when fair\\nvalue was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency\\nare not retranslated. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the\\nretranslation of monetary items, are included in the Income Statement for the period.\\nJoint operations\\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the assets,\\nand obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement or that other facts and circumstances indicate that\\nthis is the case. The Company\\'s share of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows are combined with\\nthe equivalent items in the financial statements on a line-by-line basis.\\n18\\n\\n--- End of Page 1 ---\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\nPensions\\nThe Company participates in both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.\\n(i) Defined benefit pension schemes\\nThe asset or deficit recognised in the Statement of Financial Position in respect of the defined benefit plan\\nrepresents the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligations at the\\nreporting date. Net plan assets are recognised only to the extent that the present value of the economic\\nbenefit is available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\\nDefined benefit obligations for the scheme are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the\\nprojected unit method. The present value of these obligations is determined by discounting the estimated\\nfuture cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the\\ncurrency in which the benefits will be paid. The bonds used have terms to maturity approximating the\\nterms of the related pension obligation.\\nThe Company recognises actuarial gains and losses, arising from experience adjustments and changes in\\nactuarial assumptions, in the period in which they occur in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Past\\nservice costs are recognised immediately in the Income Statement, unless the changes to the pension\\nplan are conditional on the employee remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting\\nperiod). In these cases, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\\nCurrent service costs and any past service costs, together with the unwinding of the discount on plan\\nliabilities less the expected return on plan assets, are included within operating costs.\\n(ii) Defined contribution pension schemes\\nFor defined contribution schemes, the Company pays contributions to independently administered funds.\\nThe Company has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The\\ncontributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.\\nDefined contribution pension costs charged to the Income Statement represent contributions payable in\\nrespect of the year\\nFinancial assets\\nThe Company classifies its financial assets under loans and receivables: Non-derivative financial assets with\\nfixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. The Company\\'s loans and receivables\\ncomprise receivables and cash. The Company has no financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.\\nTrade and other receivables mainly consist of amounts owed to us by customers, fellow group undertakings\\nand amounts that we pay to our suppliers in advance. Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated\\nat their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Estimated\\nirrecoverable amounts are based on the ageing of the receivable balances and historical experience. Individual\\ntrade receivables are written off when management deems them not to be collectable.\\n19\\n\\n--- End of Page 1 ---\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\nBorrowings\\nInterest bearing loans are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to cost at inception), and are\\nsubsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, except where they are\\nidentified as a hedged item in a designated hedge relationship. Any difference between the proceeds net of\\ntransaction costs and the amount due on settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term\\nof the borrowing\\nCreditors\\nCreditors are obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of\\nbusiness from suppliers.\\nCreditors are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective\\ninterest rate method.\\nShare-based payments\\nThe Vodafone Group Plc issues equity-settled share awards to certain of the Company\\'s employees. Equity-\\nsettled share-based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting\\nconditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based\\npayments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company\\'s estimate of the\\nshares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. Fair value is\\nmeasured using a binomial pricing model which is calibrated using a Black-Scholes option pricing framework.\\nThe expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management\\'s best estimate, for the effects\\nof non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioral considerations.\\nWhere the Vodafone Group Plc grants rights or share options over its shares to employees of the Company, the\\nCompany records this as a capital contribution directly in equity. Where the Company makes cash payments to\\nits ultimate parent in respect of any rights or share options granted, such cash contributions are accounted for\\nas a reduction in the capital contribution received (see note 20).\\nFinance costs\\nFinance costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.\\nProvisions\\nProvisions for asset restoration obligations, restructuring costs and other claims are recognised when the\\nCompany has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow\\nof resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are\\nmeasured at the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-\\ntax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specific to the\\nobligation.\\n20\\n\\n--- End of Page 1 ---\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\\nEstimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors,\\nincluding expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\\nThe Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates\\nwill, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a\\nsignificant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next\\nfinancial year are addressed below.\\n(a) Revenue recognition\\n(i) Arrangements with multiple deliverables\\nIn revenue arrangements where more than one good or service is provided to the customer,\\ncustomer consideration is allocated between the goods and services using relative fair value\\nprinciples. The fair values determined for deliverables may impact the timing of the recognition of\\nrevenue.\\nDetermining the fair value of each deliverable can require complex estimates. The Company\\ngenerally determines the fair value of individual elements based on prices at which the deliverable\\nis regularly sold on a stand-alone basis after considering any appropriate volume discounts.\\n(ii) Gross versus net presentation\\nWhen the Company sells goods or services as a principal, income and payments to suppliers are\\nreported on a gross basis in revenue and operating costs. If the Company sells goods or services as\\nan agent, revenue and payments to suppliers are recorded in revenue on a net basis, representing\\nthe margin earned. Whether the Company is considered to be the principal or an agent in the\\ntransaction depends on analysis by management of both the legal form and substance of the\\nagreement between the Company and its business partners; such judgements impact the amount\\nof reported revenue and operating expenses but do not impact reported assets, liabilities or cash\\nflows.\\n(b) Taxation\\n. The Company\\'s tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax\\ncharges. The calculation of the Company\\'s total tax charge involves estimation and judgement in\\nrespect of certain matters where the tax impact is uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the\\nrelevant tax authority or through a legal process. The final resolution of some of these items, which can\\ntake many years, may give rise to material profits, losses and/or cash flows.\\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets, particularly in respect of tax losses, is based upon whether it is\\nprobable that there will be sufficient and suitable taxable profits in the Company or the UK tax group\\nagainst which to utilise the assets in the future.\\nJudgement is required when determining probable future taxable profits. The Company assesses the\\navailability of future taxable profits using the same undiscounted five year forecasts for the Company\\'s\\noperations as are used in the Group\\'s value in use calculations. Where tax losses are forecast to be\\nrecovered beyond the five year period, the availability of taxable profits is assessed using the cash flows\\nand long-term growth rates used for the value in use calculations.\\n21\\n\\n--- End of Page 1 ---\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\n(b) Taxation (continued)\\nChanges in the assumptions which underpin the Company\\'s forecasts could have an impact on the\\namount of future taxable profits and could have a significant impact on the period over which the\\ndeferred tax asset would be recovered.\\nThe Company only considers substantively enacted tax laws when assessing the amount and\\navailability of tax losses to offset against the future taxable profits. See note 7 \"Income tax on ordinary\\nactivities\"\\n(c) Finite lived intangible assets\\nOther intangible assets include amounts spent by the Company acquiring investments, licences fees\\nand the costs of purchasing and developing computer software.\\nWhere intangible assets are acquired through business combinations and no active market for the\\nassets exists, the fair value of these assets is determined by discounting estimated future net cash flows\\ngenerated by the asset. Estimates relating to the future cash flows and discount rates used may have a\\nmaterial effect on the reported amounts of finite lived intangible assets.\\nThe useful life over which intangible assets are amortised depends on management\\'s estimate of the\\nperiod over which economic benefit will be derived from the asset. Reducing the useful life will increase\\nthe amortisation charge in the Income Statement. Useful lives are periodically reviewed to ensure that\\nthey remain appropriate. The basis for determining the useful life for the most significant categories of\\nintangible assets is discussed below.\\nThe estimated useful life of licence fees is generally the term of the licence unless there is a\\npresumption of renewal at negligible cost; this is adjusted if necessary, for example taking into account\\nthe impact of any expected changes in technology.\\nThe useful life of software is based on management\\'s view, considering historical experience with\\nsimilar products as well as anticipation of future events which may impact their life such as changes in\\ntechnology. The useful life will not exceed the duration of the licence.\\n(d) Property, plant and equipment\\nProperty, plant and equipment represents 25.9% (2015: 23.9%) of the Company\\'s total assets;\\nestimates and assumptions made may have a material impact on their carrying value and related\\ndepreciation charge. See note 9 \"Property, plant and equipment.\\nThe depreciation charge for an asset is derived using estimates of its expected useful life and expected\\nresidual value, which are reviewed annually. Increasing an asset\\'s expected life or residual value would\\nresult in a reduced depreciation charge in the Income Statement. Management determines the useful\\nlives and residual values for assets when they are acquired, based on experience with similar assets and\\ntaking into account other relevant factors such as any expected changes in technology. The useful life\\nof network infrastructure is assumed not to exceed the duration of related operating licences unless\\nthere is a reasonable expectation of renewal or an alternative future use for the asset.\\n22\\n\\n--- End of Page 1 ---\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n. FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n1. Statement of accounting policies (continued)\\n(e) Post-employment benefits\\nManagement judgement is exercised when determining the Company\\'s liabilities and expenses arising\\nfor defined benefit pension schemes. Management is required to make assumptions regarding future\\nrates of inflation, salary increases, discount rates and longevity of members, each of which may have a\\nmaterial impact on the defined benefit obligations that are recorded. Further details, including a\\nsensitivity analysis, are included in note 21 \"Post-employment benefits\".\\n(f) Impairment reviews\\nIFRS requires management to perform impairment tests annually for indefinite lived assets and, for\\nfinite lived assets, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not\\nbe recoverable\\nImpairment testing requires management to judge whether the carrying value of assets can be\\nsupported by the net present value of future cash flows that they generate. Calculating the net present\\nvalue of the future cash flows requires assumptions to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters\\nincluding management\\'s expectations of\\nGrowth in EBITDA, calculated as adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;\\nTiming and amount of future capital expenditure, licence and spectrum payments;\\n.\\nLong-term growth rates; and\\n.\\nAppropriate discount rates to reflect the risks involved.\\nManagement prepares formal five year forecasts for the Company\\'s operations, which are used to\\nestimate their value in use.\\nChanging the assumptions selected by management, in particular the discount rate and growth rate\\nassumptions used in the cash flow projection, could significantly affect the Company\\'s impairment\\nevaluation and hence reported assets and profits or losses.\\n(g) Provisions\\nThe Company exercises judgement in measuring and recognising provisions. A provision is determined\\nbased on the best estimate of amounts required to settle the obligation taking into account all\\navailable information. Given the uncertainties inherent in the estimates used to determine the amount\\nof the provision, actual outflow of resources may differ from the amounts recognised originally on the\\nbasis of the estimates.\\n23\\n\\n--- End of Page 1 ---\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n2.

Therefore the rate of 18%\\n(2015: 20%) has been used to calculate the deferred tax asset/(liability), with an adjustment being made for the\\nexpected movement in the asset/(liability) at the 19% rate during the years ended 31 March 2017, 31 March\\n2018, 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2020.\\nAn amount of £98.0m (2015: £3.5m) was charged to the Income Statement in respect of this rate reduction.\\nThe standard rate of tax for the year, based on the UK standard rate of corporation tax, is 20% (2015: 21%).

These options are normally\\nexercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant. The vesting of some of these options was\\nsubject to satisfaction of performance conditions.\\nVodafone Group Sharesave Plan\\nThe Vodafone Group 2008 Sharesave Plan and its predecessor, the Vodafone Group 1998 Sharesave\\nScheme enables UK staff to acquire shares in Vodafone Group Plc through monthly savings of up to £250\\nover a three or five year period, at the end of which they also receive a tax free bonus. The savings and\\nbonus may then be used to purchase shares at the option price, which is set at the beginning of the\\ninvitation period and usually at a discount of 20% to the then prevailing market price of the shares.\\n(ii) Share plans\\nVodafone Group executive plans\\nUnder the Vodafone Global Incentive Plan awards of shares are granted to directors and certain\\nemployees. The release of these shares is conditional upon continued employment and for some awards\\nachievement of certain performance targets measured over a three year period.\\nVodafone Share Incentive Plan\\nThe Vodafone Share Incentive Plan enables staff to acquire shares in Vodafone Group Plc through\\nmonthly purchases of up to £125 per month or 5% of salary, whichever is lower.

Post-employment benefits\\nThe Company\\'s pension plans are provided through both defined benefit and defined contribution\\narrangements. Defined benefit schemes provide benefits based on the employees\\' length of pensionable\\nservice and their final pensionable salary or other criteria. Defined contribution schemes offer employees\\nindividual funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement.\\nDefined benefit plans\\nThe defined benefit plans are administered by Trustee Boards that are legally separated from the Company. The\\nTrustee Board of each pension fund consists of representatives who are employees, former employees or are\\nindependent from the Company. The Boards of the pension funds are required by law to act in the best interest\\nof the plan participants and are responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment and contribution\\npolicies, and the governance of the fund.\\nThe Company\\'s main defined benefit scheme is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (\\'Vodafone UK plan\\').\\nThere are two segregated sections of the Vodafone UK plan, the pre-existing assets and liabilities of the\\nVodafone UK plan in the Vodafone Section and the former Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan\\n(\"CWWRP\") assets and liabilities, which were transferred into the Vodafone UK plan on 6 June 2014, in the CWW\\nSection, with the CWWRP then being wound up. The pre-existing Vodafone UK plan and the former CWWRP plan\\nclosed to future accrual on 31 March 2010 and 30 November 2013 respectively. Until 30 November 2013 the\\nCWWRP allowed employees to accrue a pension at a rate of 1/85th of their final salary for each year of service\\nuntil the retirement age of 60 with a maximum pension of two thirds of final salary. Employees contributed 5%\\nof their salary into the scheme.\\nThe Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HMRC and is subject to UK legislation\\nand oversight from the Pensions Regulator. UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently\\nand that valuations are undertaken at least every three years. Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone\\nSection and CWW Section. Within 15 months of each valuation date, the plan trustees and the Company must\\nagree any contributions required to ensure that the plan is fully funded over time on a suitably prudent\\nmeasure.\\nThe most recent valuations for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section of the Vodafone UK plan were carried\\nout as at 31 March 2013 by independent actuaries appointed by the plan trustees. These valuations revealed a\\ntotal deficit of £437 million on the schemes\\' funding basis. Following the valuation, the Company paid special\\none-off contributions totalling £279 million in April 2014 (£239 million into the Vodafone Section and £40\\nmillion into the CWW Section). These lump sum contributions represented accelerated funding amounts that\\nwould otherwise have been due over the period to 31 March 2020. No further contributions were therefore due\\nto the Vodafone UK plan for the period to 31 March 2016. The next valuation, which is being performed as at 31\\nMarch 2016, will be completed during the 2017 financial year after which the position of the scheme will be\\nreassessed.\\n37\\n\\n--- End of Page 1 ---\\n\\nVODAFONE LIMITED\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016\\n21. Post-employment benefits (continued)\\nThe Vodafone Section of the Vodafone UK plan covers a number of UK based employers within the Vodafone\\nGroup. Individual companies\\' contribution, including the impact of any surplus or deficit overall within the\\nscheme, have been accounted by each company in the same proportion since 31 March 2010, when the plan\\nclosed to future accrual, based on members employed in the company at that time.\\nThe Company also operates the THUS Group plc Pension Scheme and two further small schemes.\\nThe funding policies for these schemes are reviewed on a systematic basis in consultation with the independent\\nscheme actuaries in order to ensure that the funding contributions from sponsoring employers are appropriate\\nto meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term.\\nDefined contribution pension schemes\\nDefined contribution pension costs charged to the Income Statement were £50.4m (2015: £43.4m).
